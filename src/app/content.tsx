          My name is Malik. I live in Samarinda, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. I
          have an interest in frontend development and want to learn more. I am
          still young and have not experienced much, but if you need a young man
          with high enthusiasm in programming. In my spare time, I draw some
          anime character pictures and learn some other technologies that
          interest me. I am also a fan of astronomy, when I see the night sky
          full of stars makes me feel comfortable seeing it.
